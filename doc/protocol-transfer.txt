connection server:

chpt/1.2:

port: 1373

* message header fields must be separate with ' ', and
  connection created over TCP so field sequence is important.
  after message header there is just "ONE" '\n' and then message
  body come.

@ verb:
  / send / join (add yourself into group) /
	/ add (add somebody else into group) /
  / leave / check (who is online ?) /
	/ invite / new_group / delivered / sent /

@ dest_id: It can be both group or a single destination client UUID

@ src_id: single source client UUID

@ size: sizeof message body in bytes

 +------------+-------------+------------+------------+

 +----------------------------------------------------+

* other options can add without so much difficulty in this
  protocol, just with add field in message header and change serialize
  function.
* every non-standard packet dropped.(But not now .... maybe later [ha ha ha])
* when clients goes into block mode no more messages can be sent between
  these to clients (see blow for more information)[ha ha ha]
