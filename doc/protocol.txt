connection server:

chpt/1.1:

port: ?

* message header fields must be separate with ' ', and
  connection created over TCP so field sequence is important.
  after message header there is just ONE '\n' and then message
  body come.

@ verb: send / join (add yourself into group)
	/ add (add somebody else into group)
        / leave / check (who is online?)

@ dest_id: It can be both group or a single destination client UUID

@ src_id: single source client UUID

@ size: sizeof message body in bytes

 +------------+--------------------------+------------+
 |    verb    |   dest_id   |   src_id   |     size   |

* other options can add without so much difficulty in this
  protocol with add field in message header and change serialize
  function.
* every non-standard packet dropped.

=> send: verb = send

=> join: verb = join

 * please note that if group_id == client_id, your client will be signed in !! :-)
