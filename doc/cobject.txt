Chapat Object:

struct chobj {
	int is_group;
	char id[255];
	chobj *next;
	... (Techninal fields used only in networking)
}

chobj (Chapat Object) is a most important structure in chapat,
if is_group field in chobj != 1 then it is a person not group
so next field must be NULL, otherwise it is a group and next
field point to members in linked-list manner and networking
field must be set to zero.
